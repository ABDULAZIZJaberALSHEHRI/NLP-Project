# ðŸ“° Fake News Classifier  Using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify news articles as **Fake or Real** using different machine learning models like **NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)**. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to transform text into numerical features for training.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text for training.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting text into numerical format.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**:
  - NaÃ¯ve Bayes
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve.
